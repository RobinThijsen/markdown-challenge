## A funny story

At 20 when I was watching videos on youtube, I tried a color blind test on a video of Dr. Nozman.
At this moment, I didn't knowing I was color blind so I made them like "Yeah, no prob.".
But arrived at some red and green test color. I see the number color blind is supposed to see.
In a whole doubt, I check if its normal in the comment of the video and on internet.
But the verdict dropped, I was color blind.
Thankfully, thats so light i don't even discovered it during 20 years.

### TL;DR

I discovered I am color blind at the age of 20 when I was watching a video of Dr. Nozman who was displaying color blind exercices.
